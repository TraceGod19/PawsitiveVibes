        <p class="c1">Raising a puppy is like raising a child! They have infectious energy which can melt even the most stone-hearted person. You become a pet parent and your child gets a sibling. You just can’t get enough of the snuggling, the ‘awooos’ & belly rubs.
            But even in these cute moments, you are sometimes left scratching your head. How do you teach your puppy to sit? Stay? Or leave it? These are some basic commands which need to be taught to a puppy for better communication between you two. 
            As a pet parent, you should teach & train your puppy to follow these basic commands<br>
            
           1. Sit<br>
           2. Come <br>
           3. Down<br>
           4. Stay<br> 
           5. Leave it</p><br>
